# How to Monitor Your Computer's Performance Using Task Manager and Resource Monitor
Monitoring your computer's performance is important to spot issues like slowdowns or overuse of resources. Windows offers two useful tools – Task Manager and Resource Monitor – to help you keep track of your system’s performance.

### 2. Resource Monitor
Resource Monitor gives more detailed information about your computer’s resource usage, helping you see what’s taking up CPU, memory, disk, and network space.
 **How to open Resource Monitor**:
* Open Task Manager and go to the Performance tab.
* Click “Open Resource Monitor” at the bottom of the window.
 **Using Resource Monitor**:
* The Overview tab gives you a quick summary of all resource usage.
