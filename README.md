## There are two primary ways to create a bootable USB for Windows 10: using Microsoft's Media Creation Tool or using a third-party application called Rufus.
### Method 1: Using the Media Creation Tool
Download the Media Creation Tool: First, go to Microsoft's official website and download the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool.
Run the Tool: After downloading, open the tool and accept the license agreement.
Select Installation Media: Choose the option "Create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) for another PC" and click Next.
Choose Your Preferences: Select your language, Windows edition, and architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). If you're unsure, you can leave it to the recommended settings for your PC.
Choose USB Flash Drive: Pick "USB flash drive" and hit Next.
Select the USB Drive: From the list, choose the USB drive you wish to use (it should be at least 8 GB). Then, click Next.
Start the Process: The tool will download the necessary files and create the bootable USB drive. Wait for the process to finish and click Finish once completed.
### Method 2: Using Rufus (Alternative Tool)
Download Rufus: Download Rufus, a free tool that creates bootable drives, from the official website.
Launch Rufus: Open the program (no installation required) and insert your USB drive into your computer.
Select the ISO File: In Rufus, locate the Windows 10 ISO you have already downloaded from Microsoft's website.
Configure Settings: Set the partition scheme according to your system type. For UEFI-based systems, choose GPT, and for older BIOS systems, choose MBR.
Create the Bootable Drive: Press Start to begin creating the bootable USB. It will warn you about data being erased from the USB, so make sure to back up any important files before continuing.
